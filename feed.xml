While vulnerability assessments using index-based approaches are common for coastal areas, studies focusing specifically on beach vulnerability are limited. This study addresses this gap by examining exposure, susceptibility, and recovery potential as key components of beach vulnerability. To assess beach vulnerability, a temporal and spatial beach vulnerability assessment tool called the Beach Vulnerability Index (BVI) is developed using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Additionally, a comprehensive analysis investigates beach susceptibility and resilience by considering beach morphology.</p> <p>Data from the Hasaki Oceanographic Research Station (HORS) in Ibaraki prefecture, Japan, including hourly wave and water level observations, tidal predictions, and daily beach profile data from 1987 to 2010, were collected. The MLR model was initially used to predict storm-induced erosion, and the BVI was formulated based on MLR predictions, incorporating variables of wave energy flux, initial shoreline position, and maximum surge. Subsequently, an ANN model was introduced and compared to MLR in terms of predicting shoreline change during storms. The BVI is refined for both models, resulting in BVI<sub>ANN</sub> for the ANN model and BVI<sub>MRL</sub> for the MLR model.</p> <p>The comprehensive analysis categorizes beach profiles into four groups: unbarred, inner zone sandbar, outer zone sandbar, and double sandbar. Statistical analyses and metric development were conducted to assess beach susceptibility using the Beach Erosion Susceptibility Number (BESN) and beach resilience using the Beach Resilience Number (BRN). The study successfully identified key morphometric factors that influence beach erosion and quantified the BESN accordingly. Additionally, 10-day post-storm beach recovery calculations were employed to quantify the BRN as a ratio relative to the erosion that occurred during the storm. Both the BESN and BRN are valuable tools for chronological analysis of beach characteristics and for identifying abrupt changes in the beach system resulting from unexpected events in coastal zones. To select the morphometric indicators, XGBoost regression models were fitted for both susceptibility and resilience quantification. The SHAP explanation method was then applied to globally and locally quantify the importance of each morphometric feature in influencing the outcomes of the models.</p> <p>During the preliminary study period using data from 1993 to 2000, 48 storms were identified, and the first 38 storms were used to create two MLR models. These models achieved R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.58 and 0.52 for predicting shoreline change (dSL) and volume change (dV) during the training period, respectively. During testing, the corresponding R<sup>2</sup> values were 0.48 for shoreline change (dSL) and 0.52 for volume change (dV). The comparison of the BVI calculated from the MLR predictions with observed erosion values showed satisfactory model performance. However, when the complete storm data set from 1987 to 2010 was used, the MLR model proved less effective in capturing the dynamic behaviour of beach profiles under different storm conditions. In this expanded period, a total of 347 storm cases were identified, and 5% of the data (18 storms) were used to test each regression model. In contrast, the ANN model demonstrated superior performance, resulting in more accurate predictions of beach vulnerability. Specifically, when comparing the BVI predictions from each model, the Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) for MLR were 1.33, 0.83, 0.78, 0.90, and 1.07, while for BVI<sub>ANN</sub> they were 1.00, 0.20, 0.69, 1.05, and 0.57 for indexes 1-5, respectively. The BVI<sub>ANN</sub> model also achieved higher R<sup>2</sup> scores for both training (0.65) and testing (0.62) data in predicting dSL compared to the MLR model (0.26 for training and 0.35 for testing).</p> <p>The comprehensive analysis revealed that the contributing morphometrics for beach susceptibility varied depending on the beach profile types. The initial shoreline position was found to have an impact only in the unbarred and double sandbar profiles. When comparing the predictions of the BESN with observed beach changes, a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.75 was obtained for unbarred profiles for average storm conditions, indicating satisfactory performance. However, the accuracy of the BESN was found to be lower under certain conditions, likely due to variations caused by storm characteristics. In terms of beach resilience analysis, 104 cases were were identified with no sequencing storms and initial shoreline erosion cases during the storm events. Among these cases, 79 incidents exhibited partial or full shoreline recovery, while 25 cases experienced further erosion.</p> <p>The results indicate that the MLR models provide moderate predictions of beach erosion and adequate predictions of beach vulnerability when tested with a small sample of storms during the preliminary study period. However, when the larger and more diverse storm data set from 1987 to 2010 was utilized, the MLR model showed limitations in capturing the dynamic behavior of beach profiles under different storm conditions. In contrast, the ANN model demonstrated superior performance, delivering more accurate predictions of beach vulnerability. The Mean Absolute Errors for the BVI predictions were lower for BVI<sub>ANN</sub> compared to BVI<sub>MRL</sub>, indicating the improved accuracy of the BVI<sub>ANN</sub> model. Additionally, the BVI<sub>ANN</sub> model achieved higher R<sup>2</sup> scores for both training and testing data in predicting shoreline change compared to the MLR model.</p> <p>The comprehensive analysis revealed that beach susceptibility varies depending on the beach profile types, with the initial shoreline position playing a significant role in unbarred and double sandbar profiles. The BESN demonstrated satisfactory performance, particularly for inner zone sandbar profiles, indicating its potential as a tool for assessing beach susceptibility. However, it also highlighted the need for further improvements to account for variations in storm conditions that can affect the accuracy of the predictions. The beach resilience analysis identified cases of partial or full shoreline recovery, as well as instances of further erosion, providing insights into the post-storm behavior of beach profiles.</p> <p>These findings further underscore the potential of employing machine learning-based algorithms such as ANN and XGBoost to enhance the accuracy of beach vulnerability studies, particularly in capturing the dynamic nature of beach morphology changes under diverse storm conditions. The study also highlights the importance of considering sandbar formations and sediment volume as crucial factors in determining the processes of erosion and recovery associated with beach vulnerability.</p> <p>Future work should focus on testing the BESN and BRN under various beach conditions and conducting numerical simulations to explore beach morphology changes in similar wave climates. Furthermore, the direct applicability of the BVI, trained using the ANN model, represents a key advantage that can be leveraged for assessing beach vulnerability in other coastal areas. This study contributes to the growing body of research on beach vulnerability by utilizing Machine Learning algorithms to predict coastal morphology changes and assess beach vulnerability, highlighting their potential for future applications in coastal engineering.</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Citations are then used in the article body with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-cite&gt;</code> tag.

{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
    {% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}
    <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
{% endif %}
{:/nomarkdown}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Let’s break it down: this is possible thanks to <a href="https://github.com/red-data-tools/jekyll-jupyter-notebook">Jekyll Jupyter Notebook plugin</a> that allows you to embed jupyter notebooks in your posts. It basically calls <a href="https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#convert-html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jupyter nbconvert --to html</code></a> to convert the notebook to an html page and then includes it in the post. Since <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/">Kramdown</a> is the default Markdown renderer for Jekyll, we need to surround the call to the plugin with the <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#extensions">::nomarkdown</a> tag so that it stops processing this part with Kramdown and outputs the content as-is.</p> <p>The plugin takes as input the path to the notebook, but it assumes the file exists. If you want to check if the file exists before calling the plugin, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file_exists</code> filter. This avoids getting a 404 error from the plugin and ending up displaying the main page inside of it instead. If the file does not exist, you can output a message to the user. The code displayed above outputs the following:</p> <div class="jupyter-notebook" style="position: relative; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="jupyter-notebook-iframe-container"> <iframe src="/assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb.html" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; border-style: none;" width="100%" height="100%" onload="this.parentElement.style.paddingBottom = (this.contentWindow.document.documentElement.scrollHeight + 10) + 'px'"></iframe> </div> </div> <p>Note that the jupyter notebook supports both light and dark themes.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="academic"/><category term="python"/><category term="yes"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[an example of a blog post with jupyter notebook]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">just a template</title><link href="https://salikathilakarathne.github.io/blog/2020/template/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="just a template"/><published>2020-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://salikathilakarathne.github.io/blog/2020/template</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://salikathilakarathne.github.io/blog/2020/template/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2> <p>Coastal areas</p> <hr/> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="other-literatures">Other literatures</h2> <p>Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-footnote&gt;</code> tag.
