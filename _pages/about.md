I am a postdoctoral researcher at Yokohama NU, another guy trying to understand how nature works, with a more specific interest in nearshore morphodynamics under storm conditions. Research work includes beach vulnerability quantification, beach recovery after erosion cases, and the effect of cascade water detention systems to reduce flood damages.
