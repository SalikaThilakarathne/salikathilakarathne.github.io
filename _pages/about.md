I am a postdoc researcher passionate about unraveling the complexities of nearshore morphodynamics under storm conditions, with a keen interest in novel applications in coastal engineering. My research journey extends to exploring beach vulnerability and hazards in water engineering, delving into the dynamic interplay between natural forces and human infrastructure.
