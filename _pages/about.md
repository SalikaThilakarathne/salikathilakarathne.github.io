I am a research associate at the Institute for Coastal Systems, Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon with a more specific interest in nearshore morphodynamics under storm conditions. Research work includes effect-oriented prediction of extreme events on the coast, beach recovery after erosion cases, and machine learning in coastal dynamics.
