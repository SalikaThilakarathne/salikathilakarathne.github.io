I am a postdoctoral researcher with research interests on nearshore morphodynamics under storm conditions, application of machine learning in coastal engineering tools, beach vulnerability, and hazards in water engineering in general.

Kindly note that my personal web-page is under-contruction. Most of the content are still from the forked page. Thanks.
